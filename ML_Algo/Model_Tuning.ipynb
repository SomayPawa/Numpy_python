    "#### Model Tuning \n",
    "1. there is thing initially we have learned how to build a machine learning models but there is one big truth about models :\n",
    "2. the first version of your model is never the best version that is where model tuning comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### cross validation \n",
    "1. i have my data -> train split -> 80% training data , 20% testing data \n",
    "2. k-fold cross validation like i can divide the data into k parts ->like every part will be my testing data and remaining training \n",
    "-> like step-1 i last part for testing , step-2 i took second last for testing data and so on like every time i can verify for differently \n",

    "#### hyper parameter tuning \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ridges & laso regression = alpha = learning root\n",
    "2. KNN -> n-neighbour[3,5,6 ---]\n",
    "3. decision tree -> max depth, minimum sample split \n",
    "4. max feature \n",
    "5. svm -> kernal \n",
    "6. random forest -> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. method to creating a hyper parameter \n",
    "\n",
    "1. manual search \n",
    "2. grid search cv\n",
    "3. randomized search \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. grid search cv -> knn ,\n",
    "N = [3,5,7,9,11,13]\n",
    "weight = [\"uniform\",\"distance\"]\n",
    "metric = [\"manhatten\",\"euclidian\"] \n",

    "we have a so many option based on that i have to select  grid search \n",
    "\n",
    "cv : cross validation \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Random search cv -> knn (it will search random) assume if the iteration is > 2000 then we have to used random search cv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### [ Data -> model -> CV -> grid ] = perfect model\n",

    "\n",
    "#### ensemble learning -> 3 method \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bagging  -> Random forest \n",
    "2. Boosting -> Ada boost, Grodient Boost, XG Boost (competition)\n",
    "3. stacking \n",
    "\n",
    "1. stacking :- multiple model ki performance ko stack kerta hai \n",
    "like multiple model we can used and based on that we will give the weight \n",
    "assume there is 3 different model \n",
    "model-1 correct prediction count is 10\n",
    "model-2 correct prediction count is 5\n",
    "model-3 correct prediction count is 8 \n",
    "\n",
    "we will give the priority to model-1 because it gives the correct answer most of the times\n",
    "\n",
    "2. begging -> boot strap aggregation  -> Random forest we can used \n",
    "\n",
    "here also we will create a model \n",
    "\n",
    "but we are using the same model -> assume 2000 data points \n",
    "\n",
    "random 1000 -> data1 \n",
    "random 1000 -> data2\n",
    "random 1000 -> data3\n",
    "random 1000 -> data4\n",
    "\n",
    "now svm model will train multiple times with different different models \n",
    "\n",
    "based on query all the five model will predict the answer and based on that we will get the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "3. boosting -> i have a multiple model assume 2000 data points\n",
    "\n",
    "M1 -> 2000 data like model1 will also give some wrong answer.\n",
    "M2 -> it will solve the issue and give the answer \n",
    "M3 -> it will resolve the issue that gives by model 2\n",
    "\n",
    "boosting is very much important in supervised learning \n",
