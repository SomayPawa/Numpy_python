    "##### Classification algorithm \n",
    "- it is a type of machine learning algorithm used to predict a category or class label for given input \n",
    "- classification is the process of teaching a machine to answer question like : \"is this a cat or a dog?\" or \"will this customer survive or not\"\n",

    "\n",
    "it is similar to linear but the difference is curve should be \"S\" not a linear \n",
    "\n",
    "here we are predicting 0 or 1 like true or false or yes/no\n",

    "2. Result can be negative 0< and positive >1\n",
